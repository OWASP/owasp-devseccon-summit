1) resubmit the summit as "owasp summit' in OCMS (Seba)
2) explain to the board / community at large that this will be a "pure" owasp summit (with devseccon as sponsor) (Seba)
3) get commitment on the contract/reservation payments, based on the currently available budget -
depends on venue proposal/formula
4) reach out (again) to Gary/Laura to move the project summit budget to the summit (Seba)
5) review of the sponsor pack
6) add a point about the venue
venue specifics to be discussed with Dinis
perfect for summit setup
villas - good layout
5 villas = summit for 100 people
6 people sleep per villa
downstairs used for meetings
big venue = bigger Working-Sessions
if we have more than 100 people we can scale up.
the whole facility makes sense as of 150 people

25K GBP to block the place

negotiations to be started
book the 5 villas = 10K GBP - can be booked - even book 7 or 10
limited availability on the villas
2 or 3 blocks are really close to the venue and to each other

forward proposal to Laura (Seba)
tickets to be put online

name the villas ...
