subject: Please participate in the OWASP Summit Working-Sessions on Threat Modeling

Hi xxx, as one of the key players in the Threat Modeling space, it is critical that you join us at the next Owasp-DevSecCon Summit 2017 (April or June)

The question I would like you to think of is: "If you could get the best minds in the world that care about Threat Modeling in one place to work together on focused working sessions, WHAT should they work on?"

Using the same model as the past two OWASP Summits in Portugal, this 5 day event will be a 16h day high energy experience, where the attendees are expected to work and collaborate really hard. Every working session will be thoroughly prepared and focused on actionable outcomes.

We have started a first pass at possible Threat Modeling sessions at https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit/blob/master/Working-Sessions/Threat-Model.md, and it would be great if you could take a look at see what is missing

More importantly we are currently trying to pick up a date that works for the key players (you included), so could you add your choices to http://doodle.com/poll/e8d4p955rc8guuru

Let me know if you have any questions

Best regards

Dinis Cruz
