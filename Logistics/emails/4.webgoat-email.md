Nanne, can you also:
- Fill in this doodle with your preferred dates: http://doodle.com/poll/e8d4p955rc8guuru
- Add more info about you to https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/blob/master/Participants/Nanne-Baars.md
- Add more info about the WebGoat Working-Sessions to https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/blob/master/Working-Sessions/WebGoat.md , namely (in an ideal world) WHO should be there and what would be the topics of the Working-Sessions?

Bruce (CCed), can you also do this? Since WE HAVE TO HAVE YOU there at the Summit (as one of the main creators of WebGoat).

Nanne and Brunce, the question you need to answer is: "If you could get the best minds in the world that care about WebGoat (from WebGoat Developers, to WebGoat users, to companies/appsec-teams that use WebGoat as part of their product/services), in one place for interrupted working session, WHAT should they focus on?"

Of course that these Working-Sessions will need a lot of planning and logistics (specially since we really want some solid outcomes), but for now, we need to make sure that the key players are coming.

Thanks a lot for joining the Summit Workshop Organisation team :)

Dinis
