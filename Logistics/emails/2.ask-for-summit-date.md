### Ask for Summit Date

Hi,

We want you to join us at the first owasp-devseccon-summit in 2017 in the UK!

OWASP is joining forces with DevSecCon to create a Summit focused on the collaboration between Developers and Application Security. This is not a conference with uni-directional presentations, this is a working summit with working sessions. More details are available on:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Owasp-DevSecCon-Summit
and https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit

1) First important question: can you make it to the summit?
Here are the 5 possible weeks we plan on organizing the summit:

Please indicate your availability by marking your possible weeks with Yes-No-Ifneedbe.
We will select the final week by 5 Dec COB.

2) Secondly we want to make sure we have invited the DevOps and AppSec people you think should join us.
Have a look at the current list:
https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit/blob/master/Participants/_To-invite.md
and let us know who to invite on top of this list (reply to us or with a GitHub pull request).

3) Budget! we currently estimate the average cost per attendee at 2000 USD, including travel and accomodation.
Will you (or your organisation) cover this cost? Or will you need support from the summit to cover (parts of) your costs?
This could also be covered by your affiliated OWASP chapter or project: please let us know if that is possible?

Thank you!

CU at the summit...

Seba, Dinis & Francois
