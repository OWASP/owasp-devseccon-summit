# INPUT for 50K USD seed funds requested to the OWASP board (for meeting 14 Dec 2016)

Here is more input for our request to have 50K USD set aside for the upcoming owasp-devseccon-summit next year in the UK.

Our draft budget is available here:
https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit/blob/master/Budget/owasp-devseccon-summit-budget%20v20161211.xlsx
We will further refine and improve this together with Laura and Andrew in the coming weeks.

We already submitted the summit in OCMS. Which is  being followed-up by the OWASP staff.

The summit will be on 12-19 June in the UK. We have are talking with the venue Center Parcs Woburn Forest - 18M from Luton airport, 50M from Heathrow airport). The budget is based on the latest quote.


We will involve Laura, Matt and Andrew in the contract negotiations.

Let's be clear: **we do not ask for 50K as a sunk cost or as a blank cheque**.
We will tap into several sources of income to organize this summit:

1. people coming to the summit will be asked to cover their own travel/accommodation. We will only sponsor invited people that do not have support from their own organisation.
2. we will ask the participating projects for seed funds: e.g. SAMM already donated 10.000 USD 
3. we will ask chapters to sponsor the summit with the budget they have available (potentially 750K+ USD) The London chapter alrady donated 7.500 USD
4. we will create sponsor packages for our regular OWASP sponsors to support this summit

We do not expect that we will be making a profit, and that is not our goal. 
But we will definitely want to break-even with the above sources of income (like we already did with the SAMM summits in previous years).
We see the 50K seed fund as our "starting capital" to assure that we can book the venue and start the logistics.
Our goal is to "refund" this 50K as quickly as possible.
And, of course, we will involve you and the staff on any major steps that would impact the financial bottom-line.

##What do we get out of this, or what is our "ROI"?
It all starts with getting the right people together working on the right content. 
So our main goal is to organize Working-Sessions, sessions & sprints at the summit driven by both DevOps and AppSec people & principles.
The first list and (active) collaboration is already starting here:
https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit/tree/master/Working-Sessions.

Our objective is to make a big impact and productivity boost on our projects and community by getting the main DevOps and AppSec people in one venue for 5 days 24/7 in "summit-mode". We are getting very positive feedback and people that indicated that they will come (see the Doodle here http://doodle.com/poll/e8d4p955rc8guuru - OVER 70 people indicated their interest).

**The Summit success will be measured by the impact we will make with our summit deliverables and the impact on OWASP projects & the community**.
