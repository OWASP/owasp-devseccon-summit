## Outcome

The main characteristic of a legacy application is: You cannot fix the base of a problem on that system. e.g. Modify the code.

**Other issues that arise with legacy apps** 
  - Not under active maintenance
  - No longer secure 
  - Ancient technology (IE 6, Active X, Some Russian Script language only 30 people know)
  - Odd technology
  - Not easy to maintain
  - Cannot provide a timely response to an incident

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**

  - Eventually, the ultimate solution is to decommission the app
  - Do cost analysis of maintaining the application 
  - You must plan to decommission the application at some point and start using new (cheaper) technology
  - Apps are not supposed to run forever

**Other less effective options (a certain amount of remaining risk must be accepted):**

  - Lower likelihood by adding protection layers like WAFS, Firewalls, Filters, etc. This causes issues when old functionality cannot be exposed to new technology. This must be done very carefully.
