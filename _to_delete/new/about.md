OWASP is organizing a new Summit in 2017 focused on the collaboration between Developers and Application Security.

This is not a conference with uni-directional presentations, using the same model as the past two OWASP Summits in Portugal, this 5 day event will be a 16h day high energy experience, where the attendees are expected to work and collaborate really hard. Every working session will be thoroughly prepared and focused on actionable outcomes.

If you care about Application Security and want to collaborate with the key players in this industry, this is the event to be.


### Vision

Imagine a place where (some of ) the best Application Security  and OWASP minds come together to collaborate and work

… a meeting of minds focused on solving hard problems that we all have everyday

… a place where security experts, developers, users, government agencies and vendors work together on shared goals

… a place where you will find like minded individuals that care deeply about what you are passionate about

… an environment designed for maximum geek-time, synergies and collaboration  

 … basically it’s AppSec from  8am till 2 am (next day)

This place is something that only OWASP can create

… because OWASP is at the epicentre of Application Security*

This place is the: OWASP Summit 2017 London, 12-16 June
