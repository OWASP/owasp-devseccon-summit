## Why

OWASP generates, delivers, and hosts a range of documents and tools that are widely accepted for their high quality; however, there is no mechanism to make these projects tamper-proof.

OWASP needs an organisational and technical infrastructure to sign documents and code. This Working Session aims to create a GPG infrastructure for OWASP. 

## What

* Organisational infrastructure: e-mail addresses, people who "own" the keys, trust chain
* Technical infrastructure: e-mail addresses, owasp.org/GPG
* Leaders should have a GPG key signed by OWASP's "master key" at end of the Summit
* TBD â€¦

## Outcomes

- GPG infrastructure for OWASP
- GPG key signed by OWASP's "master key" at end of the Summit

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

* Board members
* Technical staff
