## Why

99.9% of current InfoSec products and services provide no warranty or guarantee.

Although this has been very beneficial for software/apps innovation, the security implications have been the creation of an security industry
that is driven by marketing and has very little accountability for the effectiveness (and even security) of their products/services

## What

 - Are Warranties and Guarantees in InfoSec inevitable?
 - How to make Warranties and Guarantees work
 - What should be covered?
 - Should governments have role in (for example) providing 'Cyber Insurance' for 'well behaved companies'?
 - The roles of labels and market forces
 - Are we in a 'market for lemons'?
 - The role of Goverment Agencies
 - What lessons can be learned from the the Food and Public Safety agencies (and activities)

## Who

 - Buyers of InfoSec products and services
 - InfoSec Products and Services providers
