## Why

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a major EU Regulation which will affect every company that does business with the EU, which is just about every major company worldwide.

This Working Session will discuss some aspects of GDPR, including the role of the DPO (Data Protection Officer), the wider definition of PII data (like IP Addresses), and the need to report breaches and incidents within a short time period.
