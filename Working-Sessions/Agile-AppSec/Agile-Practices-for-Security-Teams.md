Until recently, cyber security was often considered as “nice to have” in software development lifecycle. However, due to several data breaches that hit the headlines, more and more dev teams are now starting to incorporate security practices in their processes.
Considering how agile methodologies benefit the development lifecycle, security should be approached in a similar, or same, way.

## Why

Agile practices have been around for quite some time now and a lot of organisations incorporate Agile practices into their daily operations. This working session will discuss how security teams can utilise these Agile practices to improve their position and make their operational side more productive. Early delivery, a synonym of Agile, is one of the biggest challenges for info-sec, but using some Agile practices could enable security teams to integrate more effectively within their organisations.

## What

- Agile and its practices
- Security adoption of Agile
- Architecting security for early delivery
- Situational awareness in Agile environments
- Optimising Agile SDLC security 

## Outcomes

This Working Session will result in a draft document explaining how security can fit into an agile development process.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Developers
- Security professionals
- DevSecOps
- Security champions
