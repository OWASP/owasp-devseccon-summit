## Why

Integrating information security into the Portfolio Kanban enables organisations to have fully secure workstreams through every stage of the project development cycle. In the agile world, the integration of security must start at the earliest possible stage, which in most cases is the portfolio management workstream definition stage, a stage that normally utilises Kanban. This session will discuss the challenges and advantages of that approach and how one can plan and execute this model across environments.
