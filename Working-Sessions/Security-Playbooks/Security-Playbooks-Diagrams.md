## Why

Playbooks are best described in diagrams. In May 2017, a Google image search for 'Security Playbooks' did not return a helpful list of diagrams of Security Playbooks that can be easily used and adopted.

This Working Session will assess, create, and publish diagrams of Security Playbooks.

Ayehu's site has a really good example of what these diagrams could look like:

The Phantom product seems to have native Playbook support (which can be also scripted):

Threat Connect also looks interesting:
