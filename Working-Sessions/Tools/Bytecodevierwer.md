Category: Mobile Penetration Testing (Android)

## Why

Because Bytecodeviewer is possibly the best open source tool to reverse engineering APK's. 
This workshop is the result of five months of research into pen testing mobile APK's @Securify.nl

## What

This workshop will provide attendees with knowledge on the following areas:

- The process of pen testing Mobile Android applications vs Web Apps
- The challenges of pen testing Mobile Android apps 
- The role of reverse engineering in pen testing Mobile Apps
- Tools available (Dex2jar, APKTool, Android SDK tools...)
- Rooting your phone
- Installing Xposed Framework
- Why emulators do not provide the right or limited testing environment
- Introduction to Bytecodeviewer
- Reverse Engineering with Bytecodeviewer
- How to use Xposed Framework 
- Smali code and signing APK's
- Analysing with Bytecode and Hacking an app with Xposed
- Using the Xposed Generator (new feature!)
- Pre-release Bytecodeviewer 3.0.0. with new features!

Reverse engineering APKS with Bytecodevierwer (Pre-release 3.0.0) features:
