## Why

OWASP Orizon is a source code static analyser tool designed to spot security
issues in Java applications.

OWASP Orizon's mission is to provide people with an open source tool that helps them review the following:

- Single Java classes
- Java standalone tools packed in JAR files
- Web applications packed in EAR/WAR files
- Android APK applications

This Working Session will discuss how OWASP Orizon can best deliver on its mission for the future.

### The story of OWASP Orizon

On a dark and stormy night in Milan, Italy, in 2006, I realised I needed
something to help me review other people's Java source code. In this way OWASP
Orizon was born and evolved as a security tool to parse Java source code,
build an Abstract Syntax Tree, and spot unsafe calls in the code.

Initially, OWASP Orizon was a type of enhanced grep tool. In 2008, I
started supporting PHP programming language, but the initial boost disappeared.
I devoted my time to other programming languages and technologies for the next eight
years, until in 2017 I kickstarted the Orizon project again from scratch.

## What 

- What do SAST tools need to deliver?
- How will Orizon integrate with Dependency Checker and OWASP ZAP?
- Should Orizon only support J2EE, or should it also support Android?

## Outcomes

- A team of people interested in working on Orizon
- Some agile milestones
