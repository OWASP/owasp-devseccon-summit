### Summary

This track focuses on mobile application security. It is organized by the project leaders of the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide) project. The main focus of this track is completing the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

**If you are interested in setting the industry standard for mobile application security, this is the place to be.**

#### About the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Project

Our project produces two key documents: A *security standard* for mobile apps, and a *testing guide* that augments the requirements in the security standard detailed, OS-specific test cases and secure coding recommendations. Note that our project is not related to the OWASP Mobile Top 10.

##### The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)

</td><td>
The MSTG is comprehensive guide for iOS and Android mobile security testers. It covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.

##### The Mobile App Security Verification Standard (MASVS)

<table><tr><td>

</td><td>
The MASVS is a standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results.

This document has already undergone several revisions and is relatively mature. The latest release is available in [PDF format](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/download/0.9.3/OWASP_Mobile_AppSec_Verification_Standard_v0.9.3.pdf).

### Working Sessions

To keep things simple, we are organizing a [single working session](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/MSTG.html) focused on producing content for the OWASP MSTG, as well as proof-reading and editing of the existing content. The goal is to make as much progress on the guide as humanly possible. Depending on the number of participants, we'll split into sub-groups that work on different subsections or topic areas. See the [working session page](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/MSTG.html) for more information.
