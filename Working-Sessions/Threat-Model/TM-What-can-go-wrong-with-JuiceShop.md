Get together to use the models of Juice Shop to find problems with it, learn threat modelling, and deliver examples.

## Why

Dinis proposed a set of evening sessions to create threat model artefacts & examples for the Juice Shop vulnerable app.

## What

Using the diagrams that show various aspects of Juice Shop (model 1: What's the app?  model 2: How does it get deployed?  Model 3: How is it "developed and maintained"? etc.), apply various techniques to answer the question "what can go wrong?"  
Techniques might include brainstorming, STRIDE, top-10, PASTA, CAPEC, attack trees, or your favourite.

## Outcomes

- Lists of attacks checked in  
- Possibly sets of requirements or assumptions

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Participants in the threat modeling track
- Participants interested in Juice Shop
- Those who want to learn to threat model
