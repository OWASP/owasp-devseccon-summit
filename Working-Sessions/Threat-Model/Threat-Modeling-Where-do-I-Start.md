With regard to threat modelling, the single most common question developers ask me is 'Where do I start?'

## Why

In order to run, you need to learn to walk. 

For an organisation or group to understand and use threat modelling, they should know where to start. This Working Session will create guidelines for the effective use of threat modelling.

## What

- What guidelines could we provide to help teams get started?
- What tools do they need?
- Who should be involved? 
- For starting threat modelling on an existing project/codebase - how to start without the need to cover everything (this shares some similarities with introducing tests to legacy software)

## Outcomes

- Guidelines for the effective use of threat modelling

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Developers
- Architects
- Security SMEs
- SCRUM masters
- Security champions

--- 

## Working materials

- Draft guidelines for the effective use of threat modelling

(please add as much information as possible before the sessions)
