Get together to create models (diagrams) of Juiceshop to help us find problems with it, learn threat modelling, and deliver examples.

## Why

Dinis proposed a set of evening sessions to create threat model artefacts & examples for the Juice Shop vulnerable app.

## What

- Create models/diagrams that show various aspects of Juice Shop (Model 1: What's the app?, model 2: How does it get deployed?, Model 3: How is it "developed and maintained"? etc.) 
- Apply various techniques to answer the question "what are we working on?"

## Outcomes

- Set of models checked in  
- Possibly also sets of requirements or assumptions

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Participants in the threat modeling track
- Participants interested in Juice Shop
- Those who want to learn to threat model
