## Why


## What

What sort of data does the Top 10 need, and where/who do we ask for it, and how do we weight the various types of responses (see Brian Glas' blog for "tools augmented with humans" vs "humans with augmented tooling"). 
This weightings of data will help define the approach in OWASP Top 10 2017 RC2, and also be used in the 2020 and 2023 OWASP Top 10. I want the community to drive this discussion.
