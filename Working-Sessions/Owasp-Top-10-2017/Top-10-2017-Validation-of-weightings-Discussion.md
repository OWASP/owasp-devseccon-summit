## Why


## What

Let's validate the approach set out in Session 2 given 2013, 2017 data and consider potential for 2020 data. Based upon this validation, we will need to potentially reorder, add or delete findings based around the defined weightings. 
This will help us create the weightings that will produce the 2017, 2020, and 2023 OWASP Top 10's especially as AI and ML will start to make an impact.
