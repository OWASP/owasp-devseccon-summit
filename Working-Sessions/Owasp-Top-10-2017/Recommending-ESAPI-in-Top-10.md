## Why

This Working Session will discuss EASPI (Enterprise Security API), recommended in multiple places in the new OWASP Top 10 RC1.

> However, the quality of OWASP resources will generally be based on how much effort its unpaid volunteers are able or willing to put in and how much assistance they receive. For example, the OWASP ESAPI (Enterprise Security API) project was at one time a flagship project but was “demoted”, an action which its Java project owner agreed with. Its wiki page now recommends appraising alternatives before considering ESAPI.

## Status

This session was dropped as it's unnecessary. T10 team agrees we should drop references to ESAPI in the 2017 update. It's simply legacy content that was never removed but we've received feedback that we should and we agree.
