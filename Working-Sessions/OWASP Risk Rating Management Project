### Problem statement

In security assessment particularly website security assessment, there are many methodology to assessing the website. Owasp already given a methodology for assessing website security assessment called “OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.” Also owasp give a template in excel format to calculated the risk score.But some users still do not know how to assess their/self website. Some problem are to understanding a methodology, they should understand technical also (for example: threat agent factor: skill level or vulnerability factor: ease of exploit). The second problem is when owner start assessing many website, user must copy that template (OWASP Risk Rating Methodology excel format) become many sheets/files. It is susceptive make the data/file lost.

So here, I suggest to introduce the owner/developer to assess their website using Risk Rating Management Project. Even they have many website to assess, Risk Rating Management Project can handle and record the risk score into database, so owner can assess and manage their website every time. Also owner can use this methodology in some context, for example: penetration testing project or security assessment.
