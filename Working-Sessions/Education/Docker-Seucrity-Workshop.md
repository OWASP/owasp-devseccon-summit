## Why
As every modern company integrates Docker, a workshop is needed to show the potential risks. Most risks are not new, but have higher impacts.

## What
As a starting point, the workshop from [Timo Pagel](https://github.com/wurstbrot/docker-security-workshop) will be used.

## Outcomes

The outcome will be a workshop, integrated into the OWASP Education Project. The hands-on workshop will have:

- a small concept
- a training environment (e.g. virtualbox/vagrant/docker) and
- slides

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Docker Security Experts
- Users of Docker who wish to learn more about Docker

--- 

## Working materials
