## Why

Security training is a high priority in many security frameworks, such as OWASP OpenSAMM. In some Agile Security Lifecycles, training must take place before anything else.

To start training, you need slides with different scopes.

## What

In this workshop we will:
- Determine the need for training slides, as there are university courses, and training sessions that last for one week, one day, or even one hour. In addition, individual developers' skills in security can vary.
- Share existing training slides and discuss their pros and cons. Slides are for example [WebapSec in a Nutshell (short)](http://webappsec-nutshell.kimminich.de/#/), [Web Application Security Training (long)](https://de.slideshare.net/BjrnKimminich/web-application-security-21684264), [University Module (very long)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2KKdB7MPO7xTEwtWkkwTnl5VFk)
- Share ideas about how to structure training slides
- Share ideas about how to create training slides for different audiences that can be used at all levels
- Share ideas about how to document interactive demonstrations, which are often not included in training slides
- Optimising training slides

## Outcomes

- Participants will have an overview of existing resources for training slides. 
- The Session will create a bundle of slides and integrate them into the [OWASP Education Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project#tab=Main).

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Web Application Security trainers
